# Vigenère Demo

Interactive Vigenère cipher visualizer (single-file). 

## Quick: Publish to GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository (a good repo name is `vigenere-demo`) under your account.
2. Push this project to that repository using your preferred local workflow or GUI client.
3. The included GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the repository to GitHub Pages (it will create a `gh-pages` branch) when you push to `main`.

If you prefer a manual Pages setup, go to your repository Settings → Pages and set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (or `main`/root if you prefer manual hosting).

## Alternative hosts

- Netlify: drag-and-drop the site folder, or connect the GitHub repo (publish directory: `/`).
- Vercel: import the GitHub repo and deploy (no build command needed for static HTML).

## Files added

- `index.html` — interactive visualizer (already in this repo).
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically.
